These functions were created to solve problems for the course "Finding Hidden Messages  in the DNA", 
hosted by Coursera. 

***WARNING***
The functions I wrote were supposed to deal with files having LF line endings. In the text files hosted on 
my GitHub account, line endings have been converted automatically by Git with CRLF separators.
